## CodeBook of the "tidydataset.txt"" file

This is the CodeBook associated with the "tidydataset.txt" file, that is a spaces separated values file, that contains 81 variables and 180 rows, heading included.

This file was created by Javier Eslava-Schmalbach as an assignment project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" from the "Data Science"" course, at Coursera - Jhons Hopkins University.

All the data are based on the experiment: "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" developed originally by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, at the Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory; DITEN - Universitâ€¡ degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws;  www.smartlab.ws

###  --------------------------

If this dataset needs to be cited, the original database and work should be mentioned as:

"Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012"

### ---------------------------

### List of variables

Each varible is preceded by a number between brackets, that is the number of the column of the variable within the dataset. 

The first two columns show:

 [1] "subject": The identification of each participant
 
 [2] "activity": The activity that the participant was developng during the measurement. 
 
 There are six levels of measurements:            
 
 WALKING; WALKING_UPSTAIRS; WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS; SITTING; STANDING; LAYING

The other 79 variables at the dataset show the averages of means and standard deviations of 3-axial (X-Y-Z) continous measurements. Each variable mentions its corresponding axis, and if it is a mean or a standard deviation average.
